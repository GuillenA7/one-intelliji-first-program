# üé¨ ScreenMatch ‚Äî My First Java Application

This project was developed as part of the **Java Object-Oriented Formation (G9 - ONE)** by **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/mx/education/oracle-next-education/) + [Alura](https://www.aluracursos.com/)**.  
It represents my first Intelliji application, where I practiced fundamental programming concepts using the **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** IDE.

---

## üß† Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple yet interactive application to **catalog and rate movies**, consolidating essential Java concepts such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditional structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- User input via `Scanner`  
- Exception handling  
- Basic arithmetic and logic operations  

Each class in the project explores one or more of these ideas in a practical, incremental way.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Java SE 17**  
- **IntelliJ IDEA**  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## üß© Project Structure

| File / Class        | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Main.java`         | Entry point for the application.                                            |
| `Decisiones.java`   | Demonstrates conditional logic with `if/else` and logical operators.        |
| `Lectura.java`      | Reads user input using `Scanner` to collect movie data.                     |
| `Loops.java`        | Demonstrates the use of `for` loops to calculate an average movie rating.   |
| `Evaluaciones.java` | Uses a `while` loop with a sentinel value (`-1`) for user-controlled input. |

## üå± Learning Outcomes

Through this project I reinforced:

* Java syntax and console input/output
* The difference between `for` and `while` loops
* Handling numerical and text inputs
* Logical and comparison operators
* Program structure and readability
* Commit management and project versioning with Git
